A *date picker* is a component that allows users to select a date, or a range of dates.
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Date pickers are tied to input fields, and are accessed through focusing on the input field by clicking, or using the tab key. The date picker opens as an overlaying interactive calendar that allows the user to select a date, or a range of dates. If a date is chosen, this is reflected in the input field. 



## Examples
