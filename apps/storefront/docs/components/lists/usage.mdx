import { List } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the component needed:
- Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
- Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping needed.
3. Once the component is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

#### List items

1. Place a list item on your artboard, and choose a variant in the **Inspect Panel**.     
2. Duplicate the list item below the other one by holding `⌥`/`ALT` while dragging the component downwards (to further duplicate more components, press `⌘+D`/`CTRL+d`.
3. Select all the list items and frame them by pressing `⌘+⌥+G`/`CTRL+ALT+G`, or by right clicking and selecting “frame selection”.
4. Rename the list items as needed.
5. If needed, select the list items you want to indent.
4. Locate the **Auto Layout section** in the **Design panel** and press the icon furthest to the right *(Alignment and padding)*.
5. Press the leftmost input field and replace the `0` by inserting `16` for second level indentations, and `32` for third level indentations.
