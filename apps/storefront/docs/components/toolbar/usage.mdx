## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Toolbar` component needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Select the `Toolbar` in the frame/artboard, go to the **Design tab** in the **Properties Panel** and configure the variants located under the component name.
2. Under the **Constraints** section set up the following constraints:
   - Set the constraints to **Left & Right** and **Top**.
   - Check off the box called **Fix position when scrolling**.
3. Locate and expand the highlighted _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
4. Edit the content sections:
   - Title and navigation: Triple-click on the title to edit. Edit the icon button to have the needed icon.
   - Custom content: Build your own components to swap with the nested `Placeholder` instance if needed.
   - Actions: Edit the icon buttons that are allowed to edit if other actions are needed.
5. There are two ways to change the action icon:
   - **Drag and drop**
     - Search or locate an icon in the **Assets Panel**
     - Drag and drop the icon directly into the placeholder icon using:
       - Mac: `Command` + `Option`
       - PC: `Ctrl` + `ALT`
   - **Manually**
     - Locate and select the `Icon > Nested icon > Placeholder Icon` or `Icon > Nested icon > chevron down` _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
     - Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
     - Under the **Instance** section, click the icon name to expand the menu.
     - Choose a new icon.
