Time picker is a component that allows users to select a specified time or time range.

## Guidelines

Time picker is tied to input fields, and are accessed through focusing on the input field by clicking, or using the tab key. The time picker opens as an overlaying list of time that allows the user to select a specific time. If a time is chosen, this is reflected in the input field.

Time picker can be used in addition to the [date picker](https://eds-storefront-development.azurewebsites.net/components/date-picker/).
